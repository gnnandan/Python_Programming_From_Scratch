    "POLYMORPHISM - **PARENT Reference CHILD Object**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows objects of different classes to be treated as instances of a common base class.\n",
    "- POLY means many MORPHS means forms. An object with  many forms is called as POLYMORPHISM.\n",
    "- The word polymorphism means having many forms. In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form.\n",
    "- Polymorphism is achieved through method overriding and method overloading.\n",
    "  1. **Method Overloading** - Methods are with same name but in variable numbers of parameters\n",
    "  2. **Method Overriding** - Methods that are with same names as parent class but difference in signature(Means the child class gives its own signature/implementation)\n",
