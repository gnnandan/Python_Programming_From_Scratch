    "## Abstraction\n",
    "- It is the process of handling complexity by hiding unnecessary information from the user\n",
    "- Abstract classes that cannot be instantiated. This means that we cannot create objects of an abstract class and these are only meant to be inherited. Then an object of the derived class is used to access the features of the base class.\n",
    "- These are specifically defined to lay a foundation of other classes that exhibit common behavior or characteristics.\n",
    "- Abstraction in Python is a concept in object-oriented programming that allows you to focus on the essential attributes and behaviors of an object while hiding the implementation details. It helps in managing the complexity of a system by providing a simplified interface to interact with objects.\n",
    "- Abstraction is achieved through abstract classes and interfaces. In Python, abstraction is typically implemented using abstract base classes (ABCs) provided by the abc module.\n",
    "- The abc module also provides the **@abstractmethod decorator** for indicating abstract methods.\n",
